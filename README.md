## Overview

- Analyzed a retail orders dataset to understand sales, profit, and customer trends.  
- Cleaned and prepared data: handled missing values, fixed date formats, and created new columns for selling price, profit, and total sale.  
- Used both Python (pandas, NumPy) and PostgreSQL to calculate metrics and answer business questions.  
- Aggregated data by product, category, city, region, month, and year to find top performers and growth trends.  
- Leveraged window functions and CTEs in PostgreSQL for advanced ranking and trend comparisons.

## Skills Used

- **Python**  
- **pandas** (data loading, cleaning, grouping, aggregation, pivot tables)  
- **NumPy** (numeric calculations, averages)  
- **PostgreSQL** (SELECT, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, CTEs, window functions, ordering)  
- **Date Handling** (converting strings to datetime, extracting month/quarter/year)  
- **Feature Engineering** (calculating unit selling price, unit profit, total sale, total profit)  
- **Data Aggregation & Ranking** (`groupby` in pandas; `dense_rank`/`row_number` in SQL)  
- **Time Series Analysis** (year‑over‑year and month‑over‑month comparisons)  
- **Sorting & Filtering** (identifying top products, regions, and sub‑categories)
