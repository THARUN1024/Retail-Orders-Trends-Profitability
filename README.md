## Project Overview

Analyzed a sample retail sales dataset to uncover business insights using Python libraries like **pandas** and **NumPy**. The analysis involved cleaning and transforming the data, engineering new metrics such as profit and total sales, and identifying trends across products, regions, and time. The goal was to highlight profitable products, top-performing cities, and customer preferences through detailed breakdowns and aggregations.

## Skills Used

- **Python (pandas, NumPy)**: For data manipulation, aggregation, and numerical operations.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled null values, formatted date columns, and renamed fields for clarity.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new columns such as `Unit_Selling_Price`, `Unit_Profit`, `Total_Profit`, and `Total_Sale`.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used `groupby`, sorting, filtering, and pivot tables to explore product performance and regional trends.  
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Extracted month, quarter, and year from order dates to identify seasonal patterns.  
- **Profitability & Sales Analysis**: Identified top products and regions by profit and sales volume.
